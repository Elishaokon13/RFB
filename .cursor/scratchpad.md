# RFB Project Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation
- **Project**: RFB (React-based application) - A cryptocurrency token screener/dashboard
- **Current Task**: Comprehensive codebase review in Planner mode
- **Objective**: Analyze the entire codebase structure, identify components, understand architecture, and document findings
- **Application Type**: Crypto token screener with real-time data from Zora SDK, focused on Base chain tokens

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with SWC for fast compilation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Data Source**: Zora Coins SDK for cryptocurrency data
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive shadcn/ui library (50+ components)

### Project Structure Analysis
- **Modern React Setup**: Uses Vite for fast development and building
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Relatively permissive with `noImplicitAny: false` and `strictNullChecks: false`
- **Path Aliases**: Configured with `@/` pointing to `src/` directory
- **Component Organization**: Well-structured with separate UI components and custom components
- **Hook Architecture**: Custom hooks for data fetching and mobile detection

### Core Application Components
- **Main Entry**: Simple React 18 setup with QueryClient provider
- **Routing**: Single-page application with Index and NotFound routes
- **Layout**: Three-component layout (Sidebar, Header, TokenTable)
- **Data Flow**: Real-time cryptocurrency data from Zora SDK

### UI Component Library
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Complete component library with 50+ components
- **Design System**: Dark-first theme with custom color tokens for crypto trading
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with custom mobile detection hook
- **Custom Styling**: Extended Tailwind config with crypto-specific colors (gain/loss)

### Data Management
- **API Integration**: Zora Coins SDK for real-time cryptocurrency data
- **Caching Strategy**: React Query with 5-minute stale time and 10-minute cache
- **Pagination**: Implemented with cursor-based pagination
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and retry mechanisms

### Key Features Identified
1. **Token Screening**: Real-time cryptocurrency token data display
2. **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
3. **Filtering**: Time-based and category-based filtering
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop optimized
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live data from Zora API
6. **Error Recovery**: Graceful error handling and retry mechanisms
