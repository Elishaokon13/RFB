# BASE SCREENER - Project Planning Document

## Background and Motivation

The BASE SCREENER is a React-based cryptocurrency token screener application designed to monitor and analyze tokens across various blockchains, with a primary focus on the Base chain. The application provides a professional trading interface similar to DexScreener, offering real-time token metrics, performance tracking, and filtering capabilities.

**Current State Analysis:**
- ✅ Modern React 18 + TypeScript + Vite setup
- ✅ Professional UI with Shadcn/ui components and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Responsive design with mobile support
- ✅ TanStack Query integration for data management
- ✅ Zora Coins SDK integration ready
- ❌ Currently using mock data instead of real API calls
- ❌ No real-time data updates
- ❌ Limited blockchain support (only Base chain mentioned)
- ❌ No user authentication or personalization
- ❌ No advanced filtering or sorting capabilities

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Cryptocurrency traders and investors
- DeFi enthusiasts
- Token researchers and analysts

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Integration**: Need to replace mock data with real-time cryptocurrency data
2. **Performance**: Handle large datasets efficiently with proper pagination and virtualization
3. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live price updates
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Manage multiple API calls and implement proper caching strategies
5. **Cross-chain Support**: Extend beyond Base chain to support multiple blockchains

### User Experience Challenges
1. **Data Overload**: Present complex financial data in an intuitive way
2. **Mobile Experience**: Ensure responsive design works well on all devices
3. **Loading States**: Provide smooth loading experiences during data fetching
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for API failures and network issues

### Business Challenges
1. **Data Sources**: Identify reliable and cost-effective data providers
2. **Scalability**: Plan for handling increased user load and data volume
3. **Monetization**: Consider premium features or advertising opportunities
4. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with financial data regulations

- [ ] **Task 3.3**: Optimize rendering performance with React.memo and useMemo
- [ ] **Task 3.4**: Implement virtual scrolling for large token lists
- [ ] **Task 3.5**: Add performance monitoring and analytics

**Success Criteria:**
- Price updates happen in real-time without page refresh
- UI remains responsive with 1000+ tokens
- Performance metrics show acceptable load times
- Real-time indicators are visually clear and not distracting

### Phase 4: Multi-chain Support & Advanced Features
- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Extend support to multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, etc.)
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Implement chain switching in the sidebar
- [ ] **Task 4.3**: Add portfolio tracking features
- [ ] **Task 4.4**: Create watchlist functionality
- [ ] **Task 4.5**: Add price alerts and notifications

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can switch between different blockchain networks
- Portfolio tracking shows user's token holdings
- Watchlist allows saving favorite tokens
- Price alerts notify users of significant changes

### Phase 5: User Experience & Polish
- [ ] **Task 5.1**: Implement user authentication and personalization
- [ ] **Task 5.2**: Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] **Task 5.3**: Create onboarding flow for new users
- [ ] **Task 5.4**: Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- [ ] **Task 5.5**: Implement accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, screen reader support)

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can create accounts and save preferences
- Theme switching works seamlessly
- New users understand how to use the application
- Application meets WCAG accessibility standards
